It's a type of [[Maladaptive Schemas]] for the human brain. 

A person with a maladaptive schema of Failure believes that they are a failure because they are defective in some way. This in turn creates a sense of inferiority especially in relation to others in a group. This schema can also be a cause for creating an [[Unrelenting Standards Schema]] as well. 

Some coping style with this schema:

* **avoidance**: "If I'm going to fail what's the point of starting?", it can cause to intensify the failure schema as well. This can manifest also as a nervousness for trying to go for higher levels of achievements.
* **Imposter Syndrome**
* **They take on too much**: When they inevitably fail it reinforces the failure schema.

The vulnerable child has seen experiences of failure in the past and has associated itself with failure, even though that might not actually be a logical assumption to make.

Important tools for undoing this schema is words of affirmation and understanding for the vulnerable child.

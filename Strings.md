## Multiple Stops

Two or more notes on adjacent strings played simultaneously are called **multiple stops**. 

Two tones at once is a **double stop**. There are two types of double stops:
*  one or both pitches are played on open strings
* both pitches are played on stoped strings.

It is possible to play two notes on adjacent strings at the same time for all string instruments.

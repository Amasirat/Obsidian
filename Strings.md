The violin family consists of 
* Violins 1 & 2: *14_18 players*
* Violas: *10_12 Players*
* Violincellos: *10_12 Players*
* Contrabass or double bass: *8_10 Players*
# Construction
The violin family have many common properties in their constructions.

Each instrument consists of two main parts:
* Body
* Neck

# Tuning

The violin, viola and cello are tuned in **5ths** while Double bass is tuned in **4ths**

The principle of fingering is the same on all bowed instruments but certains details are different.

### Multiple Stops

Two or more notes on adjacent strings played simultaneously are called **multiple stops**. 

Two tones at once is a **double stop**. There are two types of double stops:
*  one or both pitches are played on open strings
* both pitches are played on stoped strings.

It is possible to play two notes on adjacent strings at the same time for all string instruments. 

Chords of three or four pitches are possible if they occur on adjacent strings, called triple and quadruple stops respectively, however they are a bit more tricky to pull off.

There needs to be greater pressure on the middle string of the three strings that are required to play the three notes therefore **Triple stops are only possible on loud dynamic levels**. Piano or pianossimo triple stops are only possible in arpeggio form.

The bow is only able to sustain two pitches at the same time for a quadruple stops, so they can only be arpeggiated.

Here's a few double, triple or quadruple stops which are possible and not possible.

Since the strings have many players playing, multiple stops can be divided between each player. the word *divisi* or *div* appearing above  a score signals this.

It's helpful to specify how a division should be done for triple and quadruple stops.

* In a passage where a composer wants only half of the section to play, it should be marked as *half*. when they want everyone to join it should be marked as *tutti*, *alle*, or simply *all* in English.


### Glissando

Another technique that is common to all string instruments. If a glissando is to be performed over more than one string, it has to be broken to change strings.

### Portamento

It means a more natural and expressive method of connecting two distant notes, instead of a full volume run down like in the case of glissando.

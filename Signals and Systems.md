Signals can describe a variety of physical phenomena.

**Signals** are usually patterns of variation over time. Like fluctuations of the human voice or fluctuations in voltage, etc.

Signals are represented mathematically as functions of one or more variables, for example a picture can be represented by brightness as a function of two spacial variables. Width and height.

There are two types of signals:

* Continuous-time: the independant variable is continuous. Shown as S(t)
* Discrete-time: The independant variable is discrete. Shown as S\[n]

## Signal Energy and Power

Instantaneous Power is defined as: p(t) = v(t)i(t) = (1/R)v^2(t)

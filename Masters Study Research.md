All research notes reagarding universities at each country.
# Netherlands

In Netherlands, you have to apply using [studielink](https://www.studielink.nl/)
* You can only apply to four universities.
* If the programme is not numerous fixus, then your application is most likely accepted.
## Universities:

[Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/partner-program-master/artificial-intelligence)**19k Euros**: *I am currently favoring this one* 
[Leiden University]
[UvA]
[Utrecht University]

**But money is a main issue for this destination**

There are some scholarship opportunities here, but the odds do not look promising.
## Scholarships

* [NL High Potential](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/support/your-studies-begin/international-students-coming-maastricht/scholarships/maastricht) 30k Ruros. The most generous one but the chances are really low. 2%.
* [NL Scholarship](https://www.studyinnl.org/finances/nl-scholarship#flyer) 5k Euros, some have gotten 10k too but it's generally in that range.
## Accomodation

Netherlands is going through a housing crisis, therefore securing accomodation takes number 1 priority.

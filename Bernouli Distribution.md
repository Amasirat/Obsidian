In the event that the results of an experimentation is either a "Success" or "Failure". We call that a Bernouli distribution. 

***If X = {0 = failure, 1 = Success } then:***
**P{X = 1} = p && P{X = 0} = 1 - p**
**E(X) = p && Var(X) = p(1 - p)**

The probability mass function of this disribution is probability of either a success or failure which only takes Indicator random variables:

X<sub>i</sub> = {0 , 1} ------->  p(X = i) = p<sup>i</sup>(1 - p)<sup>1 - i</sup>

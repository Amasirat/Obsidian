It is an expansion of the [[Bernouli Distribution]] in a sense. Where it's about the state of "success" or "failure" of a random variable.

***If X = {0 = failure, 1 = Success} then:***
**P{X = 1} = p && P{X = 0} = 1 - p**

and this event is repeated n times, so the probability mass function will be:

and E(X) = np while variance is V(X) = np(1 - p)

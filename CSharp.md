Each type has a TryParse method that tries to parse a string and returns a System.Boolean of its success state.

## DateTime and TimeSpan

System namespace contains System.DateTime and System.TimeSpan

```C#
static void UseDatesAndTimes()
{
	DateTime dt = new DateTime(2015, 10, 17);//year, month, day
	TimeSpan ts = new TimeSpan(4, 30, 20);//hours, minutes, seconds
}
```

## Working With String

String has a few methods used for basic String data manipulation.

* Length property contains the length of string
* Compare(): Compare two strings
* Contains(): Determins if string contains substring input
* Equals()
* ToUpper()
* ToLower()
* Trim()
and many more, google when it's necessary...

**Strings are immutable in C#**. Any methods that appear to change it are actually returning you an instance of String and are not modifying the original object.

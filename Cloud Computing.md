Cloud computing is when a user asks a provider to use one of their servers for a fee. This option is as opposed to maintaining their own server more cost-effective and more scalable. 

A corporation or organization that provides these remote servers is a **Cloud Provider**.

**Cloud** simply means servers that you have remote access to. 

# Types of Cloud Computing

## Public Cloud

They are owned and developed by a third-party cloud provider which deliver these services over the internet. Microsoft Azure is a good example of a public cloud.
## Private Cloud

Servers that are either hosted by the bussiness and company themselves or assigned to a third-party to host their private clouds for them.

## Hybrid Cloud

They combine private and public clouds. 


# Types of Cloud Services:

## SaaS: Software as a Service

Applications that give users a subscription-based plan. For example, Dropbox which hosts your data on their servers for a monthly fee. Netflix which allows you to watch their media for a monthly fee. Youtube which hosts your uploaded videos, however it takes a share of your ad revenue. You can opt into a Youtube premium subscription however. All of these services constitue as SaaS services and have become the industry standard for some time.

## PaaS: Platform as a Service

These services are usually only used by other developers that are developing their web applications. Instead of paying for and maintaining their own servers which is bound to create additional challenges and issues, they can pay for another dedicated cloud providers to make their servers available so that they can manipulate the files and application on that software for their own use. These servers usually come bundled with an OS and most common service applications.

## IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service

A Cloud provider gives access to a minimal server for others to use for their own purposes. These services are required by people who need more control over the Operating System of their servers for example. 

## Serverless

The servers are bought, however managing and capacity planning is done by the cloud provider and the developer can only focus on building their applications. 

Three most popular cloud services and providers are:

* Microsoft's Azure
* Amazon's AWS
* Google Cloud

An interval in music is the distance between two tones. These intervals are numbered based on how far the intervals are and also the quality that they have.

In the label of the *Major Third* interval for example, Major is the quality of the interval and the *Third* dictates that the second note is the third degree from the first note. C to E for example is a Major Third. Once E goes down a semitone to E flat, then it will be a *Minor Third*.

Each musical interval has a certain quality and level of tension that results from their characteristics in the real world and the mathematical relationship between them. These can also be either **Consonances** or **dissonances** which mean respectively, stable and unstable sounding. We largely think of the character of these intervals like this:

**Perfect fifth** and **Octave** are **Open Consonances**.
**Major and Minor thirds and sixths** are **soft Consonances**.
**Minor seconds** and **Major Sevenths** are **sharp dissonances**.
**Major Seconds** and **Minor Sevenths** are **mild dissonances**.
The **Perfect Fourth** can be either a consonant or dissonant interval.
**Tritone** or (Augmented Fourth) is ambigious.

* The Perfect Fourth sounds dissonant in between consonances and consonant in between dissonances.
* The Tritone feels neutral in chromatic passages and restless in diatonic ones.

Different intervals create different qualities in different instruments and contexts.

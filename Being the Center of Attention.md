A novel study, featuring a CNN model that learns to differentiate human personalities based on video information.

Humans show consistent behavioral patterns which are **Personality Traits**.

[The Big-Five trait Model]() defines five general dimensions of human personality:
* **Extroversion**
* **Aggreeableness**
* **Conscientiousness**
* **Neuroticism**
* **Openness**
[Personality Computing]() is where machine learning is combined with psychology to understand personalities.

This model combines **individual behaviour** and **contextual information** to map a personality label.  

We need three high-level parameters for the CNN:
* Context Proxemics: Relation between **all** persons in environment
* Person Descriptor: Individual motion descriptor
* Social Group Descriptor: Describing people in conversation groups
This model also works in a one-person-context.

Although human behavior is complex, some papers have shown that a few attributes can describe many behaviors. For example, a pedestrian that walks in a way divorced from surrounding crowd, is shown to have a more aggressive personality.

# Problems it tries to fix

Field of personality computing has progressed far but still has some challenges:
* datasets **with** personality labels is limited.
* findings about persnality are restricted to **one** field

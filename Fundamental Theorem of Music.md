Direct Quote from Persechetti's 20th Century Harmony:

**Any tone can succeed any other tone, any tone can sound simultaneously with any other tone or tones, and any groupof tones can be followed by any other group of tones, just as any degree of tention or nuance can occur in any medium under any kind of stress or duration. Successful projection will depend upon the contextual and formal conditions that prevail, and upon the skill and the soul of the composer.**

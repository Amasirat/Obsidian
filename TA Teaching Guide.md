The entire goal of our TA sessions is to let students play around with code.

A class structure will be like this:

* Go through the homework of the previous session if there was one
* First a light review of a topic : *10 minutes*
* Playing around with C++ Syntax (Ask questions testing code reading skills) or solve an easy problem *15 minutes*
* Let students solve a moderately difficult problem: *Rest of class time*

# Session 1: Introductions

Spend time introducing yourselves and them to you.
Then relay these info to them:

* What should they expect from these classes
* What do we expect from them
* Our grading policy

Then work on 2's Complement with them for a bit.

Then help them setup Visual Studio for them. Either in video form or on-site.

*No Homework*

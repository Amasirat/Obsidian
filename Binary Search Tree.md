It's a type of binary [tree](Trees.md) that organizes data according to a simple rule.

**If order is defined by the type of data being stored, in each sub-tree, data with a greater value is situated in the right sub-tree and lesser data is situated in the left sub-tree.**

In this way, we can more efficiently search, and store data with a defined order. We can also access the data in a sorted way with an [in-order treversal](Inorder Treversal).

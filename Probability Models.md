It is convenient to model certain types of [[Random Variables]] into particular types of models. Because in that sense we would know ahead of time the probability of an event, its median and variance if we deduce that this particular scenario is close to a certain model. They are however in most cases the best approximation of the problem which is convenient for use and not the real answer.

There are a lot of probability models:

* [[Binomial Distribution]]
* [[Bernouli Distribution]]
* [[Polynomial Distribution]]
* [[Poisson Distribution]]
* [[Laplace Distribution]]
* [[Geometric Distribution]]
* [[Hypergeometric Distribution]]
* [[Uniform Random Variable]]
* [[Normal Random Variable]]
* [[Exponential Random Varaible]]
* [[Gamma Distribution]]
* [[Chi-Square Distribution]]
* [[T-Distribution]]
* [[F-Distribution]]
* [[Logistics Distribution]]

I'm sure there are more however this is all I need to pass my exams, as sad of a thinking that is, university is forcing me!!!!!

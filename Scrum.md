Scrum was first introduced in 1995 by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. It is an agile framework designed to help with rapid and flexible development. Although it was first introduced for software developer teams, the idea has been expanded into different types of work.

Scrum is purposefully incomplete and is intended to be used to fit a specific team's workflows. Scrum is therefore comprised of a general philosophy, mentality, and a set of general values that need to be ingrained.

Scrum is held based on these three fundamental pillars:

* **Transparency**: The entire facts and state of the work needs to be apparent to both users and developers
* **Inspection**: The work needs to be actively inspected to detect issues or varainces. 
* **Adaptation**: Teams need to be flexible and adapt when it learns new things in the inspection.

Additionally a set of five scrum values include:

* Commitment
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect
* Courage

Which anyone participating in scrum has to possess.

A fundamental unit of scrum is a **scrum team**. It consists of a **scrum master**, **product owner**, and developers. A scrum team has no sub-teams. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on accomplishing a certain goal. 

**Scrum Master**'s goal is to establish scrum and understand scrum theory and practice and is therefore accountable for the team's effectiveness. 

**Product Owner**'s role is to communicate the needs of the owner and communicating the product goal and managing the product backlog. Product owner is one person that represents the needs of the customers basically.

**Developers** have the responsibility of creating a plan of action and commiting to it. Basically doing the work required to get to the goal.

A **Sprint** is a fixed length of time (usually a month or less) where work gets done. Before a sprint starts, with the help of the entire scrum team, the goal of the current sprint is established and team works to achieve it.

During a sprint:
* No changes are made that could affect product goal
* Product backlog can be refined if needed
* A sprint can be cancelled if the entire team agrees that it can't or if the sprint goal becomes obsolete.

**Sprint Planning** is when a sprint is planned, the team gathers to identify the sprint goal, scope of the sprint, what can be done this sprint, and how it will be done.

**Daily Scrum** is a 15 minute event for the developers to inspect progress towards the sprint goal.

At the end of each a sprint two events are held. 

* **Sprint Review**: To inspect what was done in the sprint and bring the results of their work to the stakeholders.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

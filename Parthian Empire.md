Little is known about this empire due to various reasons, one of which being the fact that there have not been many first party accounts on this subject, and most 2nd party interpretations were from their enemies, the Romans who predictably did not portray an unbiased viewpoint and the Chinese of the Han Dynasty.

However the Parthian Empire is an incredibly important period of Iranian history, from 247 BC to 224 AD (almost 500 years).

They arose from a small group of Scythian nomads. The Parthians were Central Asia nomads who invaded areas that Alexander the Great had invaded and in which the seleucids had ruled for about 60 years, the same areas that Iranian Empires before them had developed over thousands of years.

There is debate about the helinistic influences surrounding Parthia, helinistic religions rose prominently after the death of Alexander and the period of the Selucids.

It is sure that Parthia had at least a partial Greek influence in its society and culture. Roman leaders spoke fluent greek as well as Parthian, however there have been over 2500 ostraca in the heartland of Parthia, Nisa, none of which were in Greek but written in Parthian.

There are clear decreases in Greek and helinistic influences from artifacts belonging to the final years of the Parthian Empire. Evidence shows that Parthians did not turn away from Zoroastrianism.

# Geography

In the beginning years of Parthia, they were confined to a small area in the south-east of the Caspian Sea, holding seperate Parthian people that declared independance from the Selucians.

Under the Parthian Kings of Mithradates I and II, the Parthians exapanded their empire from the west to the east.

# History of parthia

## Before Parthia

The seleucid Empire had become weaker by many wars in the west, which created a power vacuum in the east, giving way for many regional rulers becoming more independent. One of them was the satrapy Parthia located in the south-east of the caspian sea.

The history of Parthia can be divided into four periods.
## Phase I (247-165 BC)

The first phase is the development from a vassal state to the Parthian Empire
## Phase II (165-70 BC)


The power of the Parthians grew after the death of Antiochos III or even the Antiochos IV in 164 BC.

In the 140s Mithradates I conquered the Seleucid core provinces of Media and Babylonia, starting the further decline of the Seleucid Empire.
## Phase III (70 BC - 51 AD)


## Phase IV (51-224 AD)

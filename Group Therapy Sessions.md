Talked about darksides. Two sides of us that want different things and feel like we are different people in one. Not quite like a DID condition though.

Sara wants the side of her that is more confrontational however she feels like that side of her still hurts people, so she at the same time does not feel positive about that side of her, paradoxically.

Darkside in the opinion of Delara is a subset of Carl's idea of shadow. It is a part of us that is neither good or bad. Simply another part of us that we can not readily accept, however accepting it can be the first step in healing. 

Saba asked why Delara thinks their darkside can never interact with the outside world.
The answer was that these darksides are not necessarily going to be out of control. If supplied with Empathy, it will not turn into sadism.

If a sense of anger is justified and comes from a reasonable mental space, is that anger wrong?

We have three methods of dealing with anger:
* Avoidance
* Reaction
* Acceptance

Mr Kazemi, wants to define these before continuing:

* Shadow: A side of us that we don't like to admit that it exists, it becomes stronger through not admitting its existence to ourselves. 

He believes the way to be better and not let our shadows gain power is understanding ourselves and putting ourselves in situations that we fear or avoid. 

Saba believes that the darkside is more apparent but shadow is something we deal with in our subconscious. 

On the point of confronting uncomfortable feelings, we usually tend to avoid negative feelings, We need to find the answer to why our negative feelings come in front and where it comes from.

**Conclusion of session**:
We should go through the process of understanding no matter how painful it must be.

This session is about existentialism. 

Before existence there must be an idea of it. 

Death, Freedom, Nihilism, 

But it was decided that it was too much for the session.

There are 6 emotions that we struggle with:
* fear: Fear is a feeling that comes from our external environment. It is therefore concrete and can be identified.
* fear
* sadness

All of these feelings and emotions need to be experienced by any healthy.

# Time Berners-Lee Open Letter 2019

It's understandable that many people feel afraid and unsure if the web is really a force for good. But given how much the web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can't be changed for the better in the next 30. if we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us, we will have failed the web.

A peer-to-peer electronic payment system designed in such a way that it can operate decentralized.

## Motive

The interest of its creator was to create a list of protocols that allowed a system of decentralized transactions without thievery and double-spending using hash functions and a proof-of-work mentality.

## Proof-Of-Work

The idea of proof of work is to use computational work as the method of determining the legitamacy of a message in the network. 


## BitCoin Protocols

There are a few protocols in place when dealing with Bitcoin:
* Each owner(node in the system) accepts the longest set of blockchain in the system.
* Each transaction or block has to include a number guessed to have a particular number of 0's in its first digits of its SHA256 function's output.
* Each transaction is signed by a digital computer signature.
## Block Chain

Each person has a transaction record which details a record of bitcoin transactions in the system. These transaction records are linked together via the previous block's hex codes. 






When a transaction occurs in the system, it will be notified to every node in the system and each of them will update their own copy of the blockchain to include that block as well.
